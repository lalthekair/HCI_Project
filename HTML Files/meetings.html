                        We will start with the bare bone html files for each member&apos;s page, fleshing out the structure of the page.
                        Since the user experience is highly dependent on site organization we will link all pages to the home page,
                        which will act as the anchor for all the files.Since there is a lot of ambiguity, we decided to start with the
                        project and decide on the details later. Each girl has her own personal freedom in designing her page, the only
                        things that need to be agreed on are the home page and the meeting minutes page.

                        -	The best way to create a cohesive and integrated site is to unify the header between all the pages, so we will copy
                        and paste the header code in every single page while importing the style sheet. Having a uniform header is a way to
                        guarantee a smooth and enjoyable user experience.<br/>
                        -	To create a more cohesive site, we agreed on a color palette to ease the user experience. Having a more uniform
                        site in terms of color, even if the elements differ, is essential. The colors we settled for are purple and beige,
                        matching the logo colors.<br/>
                        -	Each girl will upgrade her individual page using the new HTML ideas we learned in the lab.<br/>
                        -	To have a usable site, we will stick with only mentioning the most relevant information and refrain from
                        turning the page into a biography.<br/>

                        -	Since we can edit list icons, we will customize the meeting minutes page when we start it
                        (it still has not been created yet.) Nested lists also work, so we can find an organized way to
                        display summarized meeting minutes in an organized and user-friendly way.<br/>
                        -	In today&apos;s lab we learned how to navigate different folders and add files to the HTML file even
                        if in another folder, without using the absolute path. We will organize the different HTML files and
                        CSS files, as well as the media, into different folders, and will have to adjust the code accordingly
                        since they&apos;re not all in the same folder anymore.<br/>
                        -	The website interface is too outdated (standard CSS from early 2000&apos;s) so we will see templates
                        online that we can use to make the website more user-friendly and appealing.<br/>
                        -	Taking advantage of the fact that images can be used as links and using them to lead to other media
                        in other websites or other pages that are relevant (ex. LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

                        •	Next week we will try to work on the home page together.

                        <td>
                          -The "div" tag is incredibly useful, because it allows us to customize different sections of the site
                          in different ways. Combining this with a class means the page has more potential to be visually
                          appealing.<br/>
                          - The "span" tag can assist in highlighting significant or attention-grabbing text, where it applies to
                          the user&apos;s cognition and mental processes, relying on outstanding text to make inferences on
                          what is more significant and less important.<br/>
                          - Relying on user memory, the flow of information should be from top-down, following a narrative
                          structure that outlines each members&apos; skills, story, and history. Showcasing the projects and
                          works after talking about interests and courses makes most sense, so it is the pattern that should
                          be followed.
                       </td>
                      <td>

                        • Implement the div strategy to better organize the elements.

                            - We spent so much time focusing on our individual pages and constantly.<br/>
                            changing/adjusting/experimenting that we forgot all about the other pages.<br/>
                            - The home page needs to be inviting, open, and follows the spirit of the site<br/>
                            - It needs to be a little simple and straightforward (save the good stuff for the individual pages).<br/>
                            - We can use a general picture to convey the idea of this course, add a few graphics, follow the
                            style of text on one side and graphics on the other to hook the user.<br/>
                            - As for the meeting minutes page we will go with a table for simplicity.<br/>
                            - To be friendly on the eyes, the focus will be mainly on the font, table division, etc.<br/>
                            - We could add lists or merge cells to summarize the information and to avoid clutter.<br/>
                            - For the individual pages, we will stop where we reached and focus on the main ones.<br/>
                            - We will postpone experimenting with javascript to when we do it in the lab with Ms. Salma.
